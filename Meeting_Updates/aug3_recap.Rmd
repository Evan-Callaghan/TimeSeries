## Simulating a Modulated Signal

From Kian's thesis we have the following formula for signals with frequency modulation:

$$X_t = \sum_m{\mu_mcos(2 \pi f_mt + 2 \pi \int_0^t \phi_m (\tau) \space d\tau)} + Z_t$$

Now let $\theta(t) = 2 \pi f_mt + 2 \pi \int_0^t \phi_m (\tau) \space d\tau$. Since $\phi$ and $\theta$ are both polynomials, we can simplify to:

$$\phi(\tau) = \sum_{p=0}^{P}{a_p\tau^p}$$
$$\theta(t) = 2 \pi f_mt + 2 \pi \int_0^t \sum_{p=0}^{P}{a_p\tau^p} \space d\tau$$
$$\theta(t) = 2 \pi f_mt + 2 \pi \sum_{p=0}^{P}{\frac{a_p}{p+1}t^{p+1}}$$

Using these formulas I wrote a function to simulate a modulated signal given a length $N$, number of frequencies $m$, and the maximim degree of polynomial to consider $P$.
